<h3>What is absorption Spectra?</h3>
<p>
  Absorption spectra refer to the pattern of absorption of light by a substance
  as a function of its wavelength or frequency. When light passes through a
  substance, some light can be absorbed by the material, which can cause
  electrons in the substance's atoms or molecules to become excited and move to
  higher energy levels. Similarly, it is the result of the specific wavelengths
  of light that the substance absorbs, and these wavelengths can be used to
  identify the substance and determine its concentration.
</p>
<p>
  TThe absorption spectrum of a substance is usually represented graphically as
  a plot of the absorbance (or extinction coefficient) of the substance versus
  the wavelength or frequency of the light. Absorbance is a measure of the
  amount of light absorbed by the substance and is related to the concentration
  of the substance, the path length of light through the substance and the molar
  extinction coefficient of the substance, at a given wavelength.
</p>
<p>
  These can provide valuable information about the electronic structure and
  chemical composition of a substance, and are applied in various fields, such
  as chemistry, physics, and biology. For example, they are commonly used in
  spectroscopy to identify and quantify the components of a sample, and are also
  used in astronomy to study the composition of stars and other celestial
  objects.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, it is a fundamental tool in analytical chemistry for the
  identification and quantification of chemicals in a sample. The absorption of
  light by a substance is determined by the electronic and molecular structure
  of the substance. Therefore, the absorption spectrum can provide information
  about the chemical composition, purity, and concentration of a substance.
</p>
<p>
  For example, absorption spectroscopy can be used in chemistry to determine the
  concentration of a solution by measuring the absorbance of the solution at a
  specific wavelength. Absorption spectroscopy is also concerned with
  identifying unknown substances in a sample.
