<p>
  The chemical elements of which our Solar System is composed are the same, and
  in the same proportions, as those found in other planetary systems and in
  stars similar to the Sun. The cloud in which our Solar System formed was
  composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, and only about 2% contained heavier
  elements. The four rocky planets formed from the heavy particles, and the four
  gaseous planets from the light elements.

<h8 id="planets">What are the planets?</h8>
<p>
  Planets are a divine or galactic body, which revolves in fixed circles around
  a star or celestial rest, in this case the Sun. The planets do not have their
  own light, but reflect the light of the Sun, and they do not shine like other
  stars, since they are excessively close to us. In the solar system, we can
  find 8 planets, which have fixed orbits:
