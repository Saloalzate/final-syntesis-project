<p>
  The chemical elements of which our Solar System is composed are the same, and
  in the same proportions, as those found in other planetary systems and in
  stars similar to the Sun. The cloud in which our Solar System formed was
  composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, and only about 2% contained heavier
  elements. The four rocky planets formed from the heavy particles, and the four
  gaseous planets from the light elements.
</p>
<h8 id="planets">What are the planets?</h8>
<p>
  Planets are a divine or galactic body, which revolves in fixed circles around
  a star or celestial rest, in this case the Sun. The planets do not have their
  own light, but reflect the light of the Sun, and they do not shine like other
  stars, since they are excessively close to us. In the solar system, we can
  find 8 planets, which have fixed orbits:
  <br></br>
  -Mercury                    
  <br></br>
  -Venus                        
  <br></br>
  -Earth                         
  <br></br>
  -Mars                          
  <br></br>
  Jupiter
  <br></br>                      
  -Saturn
  <br></br>
  -Uranus
  <br></br>
  -Neptune

<h id="composition">What is the composition of the planets?</h>
<br></br>
<h10 id="system">The planets of the solar system have the following composition:</h10>
<br></br>
<p>
    TERRESTRIAL PLANETS:planets with bodies consisting largely of rocks. 
    They consist of metallic cores surrounded by a solid rock surface. 
    Planets such as Earth, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. 
    Earth is composed of 32% oxygen, 15% silicon, 14% magnesium,3% sulfur and 
    2% nickel.  
<br></br>
<img id="terrestres" src="imagenes/terrestres.jpeg" width="450px" height="200px"/>
</p>
<p>
    GIANT OR JOVIAN PLANETS: These are planets that are fundamentally larger than the terrestrial planets. Such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
<br></br>
<img id="gigantes" src="imagenes/gigantes.jpeg" width="450px" height="250px"/>
</p>
<p>
    GAS GIANTS: They are Jupiter and Saturn, giant planets, which are composed of hydrogen and helium. They are also the largest planets in the Solar System. 
<br></br>
<img id="gaseosos" src="imagenes/gaseosos.jpeg" width="400px" height="250px"/>
</p>
<p>
    ICE GIANTS: These are Uranus and Neptune, which are composed mainly of materials with a low breaking point. Such as water, methane and alkali, with thick hydrogen and helium climates. These planets are essentially lower in mass than the gas giants.
<br></br>
<img id="hielo" src="imagenes/hielo.jpeg" width="400px" height="200px"/>
</p>
<h id="stars">What are the stars made of?</h>
<p>
    Stars are made of very hot gas, mostly hydrogen and helium, which are the two lightest elements. 
    <br></br>
    Stars shine by burning hydrogen into helium in their cores, and later in their lives they create heavier elements.
    <br></br>
    <img id="estrellas" src="imagenes/estrellas.jpg" width="400px" height="200px"/>
</p>
<h id="sun">What is the composition of the sun?</h>
<p>
    It is classified as a yellow dwarf star, type G2, and all the planets of the solar system revolve around it.
    <br></br>
    The Sun is a glowing ball, a star or celestial body, made up of very hot gases, mainly hydrogen (92.1%) and helium (7.9%). There are also traces of other elements (0.1%), such as oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, silicon, magnesium, neon, iron, and sulfur. Most of the gas exists in the form of plasma.
