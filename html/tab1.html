  The emission spectrum refers to the electromagnetic radiation emitted by an
  atom or molecule as it transitions from a high energy state to a lower energy
  state. Each energy transition produces photon emissions at a specific
  frequency corresponding to a specific wavelength. The ensemble of these photon
  emissions, which give rise to different wavelengths, constitutes the emission
  spectrum.

  Each element in the periodic table has a unique emission spectrum known as a
  spectral signature, so that by analyzing the emission spectrum of a substance,
  we can identify its constituent elements.

  Each element in the periodic table has a unique emission spectrum known as a spectral signature, so that by analyzing the emission spectrum of a substance, we can identify its constituent elements. This procedure is called emission spectroscopy, which is a very useful tool in various fields of science. For example, it is used in chemical analysis and in astronomy to study the elements contained in a star. In the following image, you can see a part of this process:

  The electromagnetic spectrum, on the other hand, is the entire range of electromagnetic radiation, from low-energy radio waves to high-energy gamma rays. The electromagnetic spectrum is divided into different regions, each of which is characterized by a specific frequency range and corresponding wavelength, as shown in the following image:

  Finally,the relationship between the emission spectrum and the
  electromagnetic spectrum is that photon emissions from an emission spectrum
  occur at a specific frequency and wavelength, which fall within a particular
  region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
