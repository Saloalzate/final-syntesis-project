<h3>What is emission Spectra?</h3>

  The emission spectrum refers to the electromagnetic radiation emitted by an
  atom or molecule as it transitions from a high energy state to a lower energy
  state. Each energy transition produces photon emissions at a specific
  frequency corresponding to a specific wavelength. The ensemble of these photon
  emissions, which give rise to different wavelengths, constitutes the emission
  spectrum.

  Each element in the periodic table has a unique emission spectrum known as a
  spectral signature, so that by analyzing the emission spectrum of a substance,
  we can identify its constituent elements. This procedure is called emission
  spectroscopy, which is a very useful tool in various fields of science. For
  example, it is used in chemical analysis and in astronomy to study the
  elements contained in a star.

  The electromagnetic spectrum, on the other hand, is the full range of
  electromagnetic radiation, from low-energy radio waves to high-energy gamma
  rays. The electromagnetic spectrum is divided into different regions, each of
  which is characterized by a specific frequency range and corresponding
  wavelength.

<p>
  On the other hand, the relationship between the emission spectrum and the
  electromagnetic spectrum is that photon emissions from an emission spectrum
  occur at a specific frequency and wavelength, which fall within a particular
  region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
